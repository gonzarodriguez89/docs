Welcome to the **Choovie Reporting API**. This guide gives you a quick mental model for how the API works, how to authenticate, and how to try requests directly from these docs.

## Base URL

```
https://api.automationhub.one/api:ZHV32H3S
```

All endpoints listed below are relative to this base URL.

---

## Endpoints overview

### `POST /token` — Obtain a JWT

- **Purpose:** Exchange your API user credentials for a short‑lived Bearer token.
- **Auth required:** **No** (this endpoint must be unauthenticated).

---

### `GET /bookings` — List bookings

- **Purpose:** Returns bookings with optional pagination and filters.
- **Auth required:** **Yes** — Bearer token from `POST /token`.

---

## End‑to‑end: Authenticate then query

### 1) Get a token

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "https://api.automationhub.one/api:ZHV32H3S/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "you@example.com",
    "password": "<your-password>"
  }'
```

**Response**

```json
{ "token": "<JWT>" }
```

### 2) Call a protected endpoint

```bash
curl -X GET \
  "https://api.automationhub.one/api:ZHV32H3S/bookings?limit=50&offset=0&from=2025-01-01&to=2025-12-31" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT>"
```

---

## Request headers

For authenticated calls:

```
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
```

---

## Pagination pattern

Use `limit` and `offset` to page through results. The response includes `itemsReceived`, `itemsTotal`, `curPage`, `nextPage`, `prevPage`, and `perPage` to help you iterate.

```bash
# Example: fetch the second page
curl "https://api.automationhub.one/api:ZHV32H3S/bookings?limit=50&offset=50" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <JWT>"
```

---

## Common issues & fixes

- **401 Unauthorized** – Missing or expired token. Re‑request `POST /token` and include `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`.
- **400 Bad Request** – Invalid parameters (e.g., bad date format). Ensure dates are `DD-MM-YYYY`, integers are positive, and enums match exactly.
- **Try It in the docs** – On the token page, send your credentials (no auth box). Copy the `token` value. On bookings, paste it into the Bearer auth field.

---


## Security model

- **Bearer (JWT) auth** is required for all endpoints **except** `POST /token`.
- Never hard‑code tokens in public clients. Rotate tokens periodically.

---

## Changelog & stability

- **v1** (current): `POST /token`, `GET /bookings`.
- Backward‑compatible additions may appear (new fields in responses); avoid strict response whitelisting when parsing.
